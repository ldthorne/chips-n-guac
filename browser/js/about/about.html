        <h4>This website was built by <a href='http://www.github.com/ldthorne'>Daniel Thorne</a> with the express purpose of allowing anyone to get a coupon for BOGO burritos from Chipotle without playing their online game. The repository for this website can be seen <a href='http://www.github.com/ldthorne/chips-n-guac'>here.</a></h4>

        <h4>This web application was built using <a href='http://www.github.com/joedotjs'>Joe Alves'</a> amazing generator, <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/fsg'>FSG</a>.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4>This application was built in response to the discovery that Chipotle's game, <a href='https://cado-crusher.chipotle.com'>Guac Hunter</a>, was making a simple, insecure, unencrypted request to their server to indicate a user's completion of the game, which prompted a text with a coupon to be sent to the user. This application simply collects the user's information, concatenates it, and sends a request to Chipotle's server.</h4>
